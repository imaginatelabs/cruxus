## Setup
1. Clone and checkout `stable` for the latest stable release version from this repository.
   Note: checkout `master` to get the latest changes
2. You will need Ruby-2.1 and Bundler installed
3. Run `bundle install` to get all the gems you need
4. Add cruxus to your path e.g. 
  `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cruxus/lib`
5. Run `cx` to test installation

Note: Cruxus requires Ruby 2.1 if you're using rvm or chruby there's a ruby version in the repo that 
will automatically set Ruby to the right version for you!

## Configuration
Curxus can be configured by placing a ".cxconf" in the root of your project. 

A basic git project using feature branching will only need to configure the following values. 
```
application: my_application
build:
  cmd: "build_and_test_my_app.sh"

```

### Inherited Configuration
Cruxus allows configuration inheritance so that you can customize configuration based on your preferences. 
Below is the order in which the cruxus files inherit their configurations.
```
$CX_HOME/.cxconf                           # Default configuration
$SHARED_HOME/.cxconf                       # Inherits/Overwrites $CX_HOME/.cxconf
$USER_HOME/.cxconf                         # Inherits/Overwrites $SHARED_HOME/.cxconf
$WORKSPACE_HOME/.cxconf                    # Inherits/Overwrites $USER_HOME/.cxconf
$WORKSPACE_HOME/sub/dirs/.cxconf           # Inherits/Overwrites $WORKSPACE_HOME/.cxconf when run in the subdirectory
```

## Extending 
Cruxus allows you to write extensions to suit your own work flow.

Details coming soon!
